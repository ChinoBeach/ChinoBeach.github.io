This site is a work in progress and will showcase my journey through the Game Programming Minor program at SUNY Morrisville. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects from CITA 113, 212, 312, and 412 classes, as well as my Game Jam submissions.

In addition to these class assignments, I may also feature some of my personal projects on this page. As I continue to develop my skills in game programming, this page will serve as a portfolio of my work.

So come along and join me on this exciting adventure into the world of game programming!
