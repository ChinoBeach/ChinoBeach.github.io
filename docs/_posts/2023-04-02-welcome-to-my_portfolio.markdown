This webpage is a work in progress and will host the projects that I have worked on at SUNY Morrisville in order to complete my Game Programming Minor. Included will be projects from my CITA 113, 212, 312, and finally 412 classes. I will also include my Game Jam submissions on this page. In the future I may use this page to include some of my personal projects as well.
