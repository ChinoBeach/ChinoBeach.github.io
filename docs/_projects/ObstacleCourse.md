This was the sixth game that I made at SUNY Morrisville.
Timeline: August 29th 2022 - September 11th 2022

This game was created as part of my CITA 312 class at SUNY Morrisville, which was part of my journey towards mastering the art of game programming. Aptly named "Intermediate Computer Game Design and Applications," this class introduced me to the 3D game programming, simulation, terrian development and a user-centered approach to game design.

---

Throughout the course, I was able to hone my skills and develop a better understanding of game design principles. This project, in particular, allowed me to get my first experience with Unity 3D and showed me how to use prefabs, Serialized Fields, input.GetAxis(), time.deltaTime, how to implement a follow camera and how to handle collisions as well as using tags to help decipher them. 

In this game you play as an floating blue peg, that has to make its way through an obstacle course.
