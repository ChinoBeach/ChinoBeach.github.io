This was the project that I worked on for my summer internship at Colgate University.
Timeline: May 8th 2023 - August 11th 2023

---
 
This game was created as part of my internship at through the Visualization Lab at Colgate University, which served as my first work experiance in the game programming industry. This internship allowed me to put my skills to use with the basics of game design, project management, and gameplay experiance and provided me with the opportunity to experiment with the UnrealEngine and multiplayer functionality.

Throughout the internship, I was able to hone my skills and develop a better understanding of game design principles and project management. This project, in particular, allowed me to work with unreal engine 5 in a 3D enviroment, build scenes and levels, work on UI design, and learn how to implement LAN and Local multiplayer to our game. We also delved into the technical aspects of game design, including how Blueprints work in Unreal Engine 5, implementing camera tracking, object destruction, and using event overlaps to keep score during gameplay and handle combat.

In this game you are taken back to ancient Mayan times to partake in their ritual ball game.

Unfortunatly you are unable to play this game in browser as it is property of the Colgate Visualization Lab, and not my own.
