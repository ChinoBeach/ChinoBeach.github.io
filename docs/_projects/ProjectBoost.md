This was the seventh game that I made at SUNY Morrisville.
Timeline: September 12th 2022 - October 1st 2022

This game was created as part of my CITA 312 class at SUNY Morrisville, which was part of my journey towards mastering the art of game programming. Aptly named "Intermediate Computer Game Design and Applications," this class introduced me to the 3D game programming, simulation, terrian development and a user-centered approach to game design.

---

Throughout the course, I was able to hone my skills and develop a better understanding of game design principles. This project, in particular, allowed me to implement better 3D player controls, learn how to use differnt types of classes in Unity, and implement the use of onion design and scene loading based on triggers.  

In this game you play as a rocket making its way through an extraterrestial planet.
