This was the fifth game that I made at SUNY Morrisville.
Timeline: May 4th 2022 - May 10th 2022

This game was created as part of my CITA 212 class at SUNY Morrisville, which was the first step in my journey towards mastering the art of game programming. Aptly named "Fundamentals of Game Design," this class introduced me to the basics of game design, and provided me with the opportunity to experiment with the UNITY game engine and GitHub.

---

Throughout the course, I was able to hone my skills and develop a better understanding of game design principles. This project, in particular, allowed me to create my own sprites and scrolling background. This project also allowed me to learn pathfinder and tought me more about enemy controls. Coroutines were also touched on in this process.

In this game you play as an spaceship battling aliens with lazers as they attack you on your away across the galaxy.
