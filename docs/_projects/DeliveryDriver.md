This was the first game that I made at SUNY Morrisville.
Timeline: Feb 8th 2022 - Feb 15th 2022

This game was created as part of my CITA 212 class at SUNY Morrisville, which was the first step in my journey towards mastering the art of game programming. Aptly named "Fundamentals of Game Design," this class introduced me to the basics of game design, and provided me with the opportunity to experiment with the UNITY game engine and GitHub.

Throughout the course, I was able to hone my skills and develop a better understanding of game design principles. This project, in particular, allowed me to create a dynamic scene with obstacles, and learn how to manipulate a character using colliders and rigid bodies. We also delved into the technical aspects of game design, including how tags work in Unity, implementing camera tracking, object destruction, and using triggers to add speed boosts and bumps to the gameplay.

In this game you play as a delivery driver who goes around to pick up packages and delivers them to customers around the neighborhood. But be careful! You can only carry one package at a time.
