This was the second game that I made at SUNY Morrisville.
 
This game was created as part of my CITA 212 class at SUNY Morrisville, which was the first step in my journey towards mastering the art of game programming. Aptly named "Fundamentals of Game Design," this class introduced me to the basics of game design, and provided me with the opportunity to experiment with the UNITY game engine and GitHub.

Throughout the course, I was able to hone my skills and develop a better understanding of game design principles. This project, in particular, allowed me to create a dynamic scene with particle effects, and learn how to manipulate a character with differnt game objects. We also delved into the technical aspects of game design, including how to use triggers to restart scenes in Unity, as well as adding torque rotate and audio.

In this game you play as a snowboarder going through a slope racing to the finish line while preforming some cool tricks. Be careful though, if you hit your head, you're sent back to the start.
