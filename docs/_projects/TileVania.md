This was the fourth game that I made at SUNY Morrisville.
Timeline: April 12th 2022 - April 30th 2022

This game was created as part of my CITA 212 class at SUNY Morrisville, which was the first step in my journey towards mastering the art of game programming. Aptly named "Fundamentals of Game Design," this class introduced me to the basics of game design, and provided me with the opportunity to experiment with the UNITY game engine and GitHub.

Throughout the course, I was able to hone my skills and develop a better understanding of game design principles. This project, in particular, allowed me to work with with tilemaps, transitions and prefabs. I created 4 differnt levels of this platformer to explore and collect coins in.

In this game you play as an adventure who can shoot fireballs at the monsters of the world while collecting coins.
